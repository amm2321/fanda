                <TD><p>My name is Aliya from Yemen. I live in the United States for about 6 years. I am tring to bring a rich Arab cultural heritage and a unique perspective. My commitment to preserving and promoting traditional Arabic products allows me to share the beauty and complexity of Arabic handcrafts with a diverse audience. My attempt to source authentic products, such as ancient traditional dress and exquisite antique jewelry ensures that clients receive high quality items that reflect rich cultural traditions. Through my work, I not only contribute to the local economy, but also act as a bridge between cultures, promoting understanding and appreciation of Arab traditions and creating a space where people can experience the vibrant traditions of the Arab world.</p></TD>
